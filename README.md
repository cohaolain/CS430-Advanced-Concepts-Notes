# Advanced Concepts (CS430)

## Ethereum (Ciarán Ó hAoláin)

Included in this repository is a PDF of the presentation I gave in the first lecture (2019.12.16), alongside the smart contract code I wrote in class during the second lecture (2019.12.18). There's also an assortment of relevant links for further reading if you're interested.

While you won't be expected to have a deep understanding of the Solidity language, it would be a good idea to form an understanding of how the Ethereum blockchain works, and why this type of technology exists. It would also be good to understand the advantages and disadvantages of such technologies, their influences, and their applications.

For links, here's:
